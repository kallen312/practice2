Write all your code in App.js

This program should allow the user to input items and add them to their shopping carts.
NOTE: Saving the value of the input is already done for you!

1. Complete the handleClick function so that it adds an item to the cart when the button is clicked. (HINT: you will need to use props!)
2. Pass the handleClick function into the button onClick.
3. Use map to add items to state variable cartList as list items in the unordered list.
